# Ello

Ello is an online social networking service created by Paul Budnitz and Todd Berger in March 2014. 
It was created as an ad-free alternative to existing social networks. 
It has pivoted from its earlier Facebook-like incarnation towards a Pinterest-like website showcasing art, 
photography, fashion and web culture.
