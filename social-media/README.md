### Social Media Statistics 2019

It is a fact of the Web, not the internet, that every click, every view and every sign-up is recorded somewhere.
This is either very creepy or interesting. The latest social media statistics of consumer adoption and usage of Social Media and 
Social networks are now so well established. It's often a strategy of marketing agencies to point-out a core 'top 5' that don't change much from year-to-year. But, as you'll see in the statistics, the most popular social media sites vary a lot by level of usage in different countries and demographics. Understanding these differences in popularity of different social media platforms is really important when targeting specific audiences. When comparing the **allegedly** most popular it's best to **review them by active account usage, not just the number of user accounts**. You'll also see that some social media platforms are growing more rapidly than others while some are now in decline.
