The content here aims at refining ideas through visual exploration.
Preparing rough layouts detailing design directions.
Setting preliminary specifications for typography and graphic elements such as photography, illustration, charts or graphs, icons, or symbols.

Concept development is a process of developing ideas to solve specified design problems. The concepts are developed in phases, from formless idea to precise message in an appropriate form with supportive visuals and content. Once you have done your research and understand exactly what you want to achieve and why, you are ready to start working on the actual design. Ideally, you are trying to develop a concept that provides solutions for the design problem, communicates effectively on multiple levels, is unique — different and exciting — and stands out from the materials produced by competitors.
